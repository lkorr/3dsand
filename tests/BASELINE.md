# tests/baseline.json — what already fails, and why

`baseline.json` records which selftest gates were failing at a known commit.
`--selftest` diffs against it:

- a gate failing **and** marked `"fail"` → reported as *known-failing at
  baseline (not yours)*, run stays green
- a gate failing and marked `"pass"` → **REGRESSION**, run turns red
- a gate passing and marked `"fail"` → *FIXED since baseline*, flip it to
  `"pass"` in the same commit

It exists to retire the attribution ritual in CLAUDE.md — "build clean `HEAD`
before blaming your change". That took ~15 minutes of rebuild. This takes none.

The file is a **flat string→string map** with no comments: the parser is a
deliberately strict hand-rolled scanner (no JSON dependency, since it runs
before anything else is initialised), and prose keys in the file itself once
caused a comment to absorb a later gate's verdict. Rationale lives here instead.

## Current known failures — recorded at `46b7ec7`, 2026-08-21, RTX 3060 Ti

Both were verified pre-existing: they fail identically at `46b7ec7` with the
old monolithic selftest, before the gate split touched anything.

### `pond-freeze`

```
pond freeze: FAIL (rim 0/96 vs middle 0/25 ice at 250 night ticks;
                   0 ice voxels, 0 frozen with 0 non-water neighbours)
```

**Zero ice forms at all.** This is not the rate-gradient problem the gate was
written to measure (rim should freeze faster than middle) — the water→ice
reaction never fires even once. Rim and middle are both 0.

Where to look: the night gate on the reaction, or its `scaleByNeighbors`
`minCount`. Note the CLAUDE.md entry on light-gated rules never sleeping — a
long-lived condition that skips `keepAwake` interacts with this. Reproduce in
~8 s with:

```bash
./build/Release/sandvox.exe --selftest --gate pond-freeze
```

### `mob`

```
micro body render: FAIL (10 micro slots, 7/14 views drew, ...,
                         0 cube instances from micro limbs)
  critter INVISIBLE from 7 view(s); first is dir (1,-1,1)
```

The `mob` gate aggregates several sub-gates; only **micro body render** fails.
The critter is invisible from 7 of 14 view directions, and no cube instances
come from micro limbs. A solo micro body draws from all 14 views, so the fault
is in how mob *limbs* get instanced into the micro pass, not the pass itself.

Every other mob sub-gate passes: steering, gait, carve, dismember states,
avatar, avatar footfalls, melee.

This one is slow to reproduce (the mob gate is the longest in the suite, ~20 s)
but still far cheaper than the full run:

```bash
./build/Release/sandvox.exe --selftest --gate mob
```

## Updating

After fixing a gate, run it alone, confirm it passes, and flip its entry to
`"pass"` in the same commit. Leaving a fixed gate marked `"fail"` means it can
silently regress again without turning anything red — the one way this file can
make things worse than no file at all.

If a gate fails for you that is marked `"pass"` here, and you believe it is not
your change: run it alone at your commit, then `git stash` — no, **don't**
(see the stash hazard in CLAUDE.md) — instead build a clean checkout of the
merge-base in a separate worktree and run that one gate there. The point of the
baseline is that you should rarely need to.
